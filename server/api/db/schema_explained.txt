Every single user puts their name into the database and is saved as a "username". The 
"user_type" can be one of four: school, work, hybrid, other. This determines what
kinds of events the user can put into their calendar. If this component is 'school',
the user can put classes into the calendar as well as custom events. If it is
'work', they can only put in their shifts and custom events. A 'hybrid' is for 
putting in both classes and shifts as well as custom events into the calendar.
When it is 'other', they can only put in custom events. The 'calendar_id' is the id 
that comes from the calendar in the 'calendar_table' that the user created.

The event_table is what the event that the user creates holds. This includes the name, 
type, priority, start, end, and location. The type can stem from school, work, or custom.
As for the priority, it can be either 1, 2, or 3. The higher the number, the higher the 
priority. When an event has its priority set to 3, the time stamps cannot be changed
no matter the situation. When set to 2, the time stamp can be changed as a last
minute resort, and for 1 the timestamp can be changed whenever.

A calendar_table holds all 7 days of the week, which is a VARCHAR that contains
id's referencing the event_table all separated by commas. When extracting the 
data using the API, the string is split accross commas (,) and iterated over
to get the event with the corresponding id. This table also references the user 
that created it.
